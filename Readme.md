This is errors,
a drop-in replacement for [the standard Go errors package](https://pkg.go.dev/errors).
It adds an API for wrapping an error with a caller-specified message and a snapshot of the call stack.

This module began as a fork of the venerable [github.com/pkg/errors](https://github.com/pkg/errors).
That moduleâ€™s GitHub repository has been frozen for a long time and has not kept up with changes to the standard library.
(For example, it does not export [the Join function](https://pkg.go.dev/errors#Join) added in Go 1.20.)

This is now a brand-new implementation with a different API.
